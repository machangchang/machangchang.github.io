## 771. Jewels and Stones

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:
```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

Example 2:
```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

Note:
* S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
* The characters in J are distinct.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        return S.replaceAll("[^" + J + "]", "").length();
    }
}
```

## 595. Big Countries
There is a table `World`

```
+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| name            | continent  | area       | population   | gdp           |
+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| Afghanistan     | Asia       | 652230     | 25500100     | 20343000      |
| Albania         | Europe     | 28748      | 2831741      | 12960000      |
| Algeria         | Africa     | 2381741    | 37100000     | 188681000     |
| Andorra         | Europe     | 468        | 78115        | 3712000       |
| Angola          | Africa     | 1246700    | 20609294     | 100990000     |
+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
```

A country is big if it has an area of bigger than 3 million square km or a population of more than 25 million.

Write a SQL solution to output big countries' name, population and area.

For example, according to the above table, we should output:

```
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| name         | population  | area         |
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan  | 25500100    | 652230       |
| Algeria      | 37100000    | 2381741      |
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
```

### Solution

```sql
select name, population, area
from World
where population > 25000000
union
select name, population, area
from World
where area > 3000000
```

## 461. Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

*Note:*
0 ≤ x, y < 2^31

Example:
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int xor = x^y;
        int res = 0;
        while(xor!=0) {
            res+= xor & 1;
            xor >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## 657. Judge Route Circle

Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

Example 1:

```
Input: "UD"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "LL"
Output: false
```

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeCircle(String moves) {
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        for (char ch : moves.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == 'U') y++;
            else if (ch == 'D') y--;
            else if (ch == 'R') x++;
            else if (ch == 'L') x--;
        }
        return x == 0 && y == 0;
    }
}
```
