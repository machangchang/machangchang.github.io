## （1）771. Jewels and Stones

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:
```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

Example 2:
```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

Note:
* S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
* The characters in J are distinct.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        return S.replaceAll("[^" + J + "]", "").length();
    }
}
```

### Thinking

利用正则表达式。

## （2）595. Big Countries
There is a table `World`

```
+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| name            | continent  | area       | population   | gdp           |
+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| Afghanistan     | Asia       | 652230     | 25500100     | 20343000      |
| Albania         | Europe     | 28748      | 2831741      | 12960000      |
| Algeria         | Africa     | 2381741    | 37100000     | 188681000     |
| Andorra         | Europe     | 468        | 78115        | 3712000       |
| Angola          | Africa     | 1246700    | 20609294     | 100990000     |
+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
```

A country is big if it has an area of bigger than 3 million square km or a population of more than 25 million.

Write a SQL solution to output big countries' name, population and area.

For example, according to the above table, we should output:

```
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| name         | population  | area         |
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan  | 25500100    | 652230       |
| Algeria      | 37100000    | 2381741      |
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
```

### Solution

```sql
select name, population, area
from World
where population > 25000000
union
select name, population, area
from World
where area > 3000000
```

### Thinking

Union 比 Or 快。

## （3）461. Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

*Note:*
0 ≤ x, y < 2^31

Example:
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int xor = x^y;
        int res = 0;
        while(xor!=0) {
            res+= xor & 1;
            xor >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## （4）657. Judge Route Circle

Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

Example 1:

```
Input: "UD"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "LL"
Output: false
```

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeCircle(String moves) {
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        for (char ch : moves.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == 'U') y++;
            else if (ch == 'D') y--;
            else if (ch == 'R') x++;
            else if (ch == 'L') x--;
        }
        return x == 0 && y == 0;
    }
}
```

## （5）617. Merge Two Binary Trees

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
	Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
          1                         2                             
         / \                       / \                            
        3   2                     1   3                        
       /                           \   \                      
      5                             4   7                  
Output: 
Merged tree:
	     3
	    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \ 
	 5   4   7
```

**Note:** The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

### Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
        if(t1 == null && t2 == null) return null;
        else if(t1 == null) return t2;
        else if(t2 == null) return t1;
        TreeNode n= new TreeNode(t1.val+t2.val);
        n.left=mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left);
        n.right=mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right);
        return n;
    }
}
```

## （6）627. Swap Salary

Given a table salary, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with a single update query and no intermediate temp table.

**For example:**

```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
```

After running your query, the above salary table should have the following rows:

```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
```

### Solution

* 1
```sql
update salary set sex = CHAR(ASCII('f') ^ ASCII('m') ^ ASCII(sex));
```
* 2
```sql
UPDATE salary SET sex = IF(sex='m','f','m');
```

## （7）728. Self Dividing Numbers

A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because `128 % 1 == 0`, `128 % 2 == 0`, and `128 % 8 == 0`.

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

**For example:**

```
Input: 
left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]
```

**Note:**
* The boundaries of each input argument are `1 <= left <= right <= 10000`.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> selfDividingNumbers(int left, int right) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            if (valid(i)) {
                res.add(i);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    public boolean valid(int num) {
        int cur = num;
        while (cur != 0) {
            int digit = cur % 10;
            if (digit == 0 || num % digit != 0) {
                return false;
            }
            cur /= 10;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## （8）561. Array Partition I
Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

**For example:**

```
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```

**Note:**
* n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
* All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2) {
            result += nums[i];
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

## （9）476. Number Complement

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

**Note:**

* 1.The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
* 2.You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

** Solution**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        
        while (i < num)
        {
            i += Math.pow(2, j);
            j++;
        }
        
        return i - num;
    }
}
```

## （10）557. Reverse Words in a String III
Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```

**Note:** In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

**Solution**

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] arr = s.split(" ");
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            arr[i] = new StringBuilder(arr[i]).reverse().toString();
        }
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (String st: arr) {
        	result .append(st + " ");
        	
        }
        
        return result.toString().trim();
    }
}
```
